# Snail Bait

## platforming video game 

Snail Bait is a classic platform game. 
The protagonist, whom I'll refer to simply as the runner, runs along and jumps between floating platforms that move horizontally. 
The runner's ultimate goal is to get to a pulsating platform with a gold button at the end of the level.

The player controls the runner with the keyboard: **d** moves the runner left, **k** moves her to the right, **j** or **f** make her jump, and **p** pauses the game.

When the game begins, you have three lives. 
Runner icons representing the number of lives that remain are displayed above and to the left of the game's canvas. 
In the runner's quest to make it to the end of the level, she must avoid bad guys — bees, bats, and a snail — while trying to capture valuable items such as pennies, rubies, and sapphires. 
If the runner collides with bad guys, the runner blows up, you lose a life, and you must go back to the beginning of the level. 
When the runner collides with good guys, your score increases and you are rewarded with a pleasant sound effect.
